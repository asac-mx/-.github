#  Ayúdame a Sonreír Ante el Cáncer, A.C

ASAC, A.C literal translation is Help me smile against cancer, Civil Asociation

We are a civil association based in Mexico whose mission is to carry out actions that generate emotional well-being and comprehensive support, in pediatric patients and young people who have or have been diagnosed with cancer, helping with their urgent and essential needs for a quality life during and after their cancer treatment. 

Our vision is to be a leading association with national coverage that provides assistance actions to girls, boys, adolescents and young people who have or have had a cancer diagnosis, as well as their families, so that they have a quality life and with greater opportunities.


Get to know how ASAC develops actions through the following programs:

<details>
<summary>HOSPITAL PROGRAM</summary>
Weekly visits based on a work plan designed so that, through crafts, therapeutic games and parties, children in the pediatric oncology and hematology areas can relax, develop skills and acquire emotional validation tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary>BELIEVE IN YOU PROGRAM</summary>
To materialize a dream is to BELIEVE that everything is possible, it is the hope of feeling accompanied by people who honor their struggle and are alien to them. For parents it is relief and a big hug that accompanies. ASAC has a committee that selects and manages dreams so that they can become a reality.
